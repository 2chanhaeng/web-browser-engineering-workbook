      "Exercises\n",
      "1-1 HTTP/1.1. Along with Host, send the\n",
      "Connection header in the request function with\n",
      "the value close. Your browser can now declare that it is\n",
      "using HTTP/1.1. Also add a User-Agent header.\n",
      "Its value can be whatever you want—it identifies your browser to the\n",
      "host. Make it easy to add further headers in the future.\n",
      "1-2 File URLs. Add support for the file scheme,\n",
      "which allows the browser to open local files. For example,\n",
      "file:///path/goes/here should refer to the file on your\n",
      "computer at location /path/goes/here. Also make it so that,\n",
      "if your browser is started without a URL being given, some specific file\n",
      "on your computer is opened. You can use that file for quick testing.\n",
      "1-3 data. Yet another scheme is\n",
      "data, which allows inlining HTML content into the URL\n",
      "itself. Try navigating to data:text/html,Hello world! in a\n",
      "real browser to see what happens. Add support for this scheme to your\n",
      "browser. The data scheme is especially convenient for\n",
      "making tests without having to put them in separate files.\n",
      "1-4 Entities. Implement support for the less-than\n",
      "(&amp;lt;) and greater-than (&amp;gt;)\n",
      "entities. These should be printed as &lt; and\n",
      "&gt;, respectively. For example, if the HTML response was\n",
      "&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;, the show method of your\n",
      "browser should print &lt;div&gt;. Entities allow web pages\n",
      "to include these special characters without the browser interpreting\n",
      "them as tags.\n",
      "1-5 view-source. Add support for the\n",
      "view-source scheme; navigating to\n",
      "view-source:http://example.org/ should show the HTML source\n",
      "instead of the rendered page. Add support for this scheme. Your browser\n",
      "should print the entire HTML file as if it was text. You’ll want to have\n",
      "also implemented Exercise 1-4.\n",
      "1-6 Keep-alive. Implement Exercise 1-1; however, do not send\n",
      "the Connection: close header (send\n",
      "Connection: keep-alive instead). When reading the body from\n",
      "the socket, only read as many bytes as given in the\n",
      "Content-Length header and don’t close the socket afterward.\n",
      "Instead, save the socket, and if another request is made to the same\n",
      "server reuse the same socket instead of creating a new one. (You’ll also\n",
      "need to pass the \"rb\" option to makefile or\n",
      "the value reported by Content-Length might not match the\n",
      "length of the string you’re reading.) This will speed up repeated\n",
      "requests to the same server, which are common.\n",
      "1-7 Redirects. Error codes in the 300 range request a\n",
      "redirect. When your browser encounters one, it should make a new request\n",
      "to the URL given in the Location header. Sometimes the\n",
      "Location header is a full URL, but sometimes it skips the\n",
      "host and scheme and just starts with a / (meaning the same\n",
      "host and scheme as the original request). The new URL might itself be a\n",
      "redirect, so make sure to handle that case. You don’t, however, want to\n",
      "get stuck in a redirect loop, so make sure to limit how many redirects\n",
      "your browser can follow in a row. You can test this with the URL http://browser.engineering/redirect, which redirects\n",
      "back to this page, and its /redirect2 and /redirect3 cousins which\n",
      "do more complicated redirect chains.\n",
      "1-8 Caching. Typically, the same images, styles, and scripts\n",
      "are used on multiple pages; downloading them repeatedly is a waste. It’s\n",
      "generally valid to cache any HTTP response, as long as it was requested\n",
      "with GET and received a 200 response.Some other status codes like\n",
      "301 and 404 can also be cached.\n",
      "Implement a cache in your browser and test it by requesting the same\n",
      "file multiple times. Servers control caches using the\n",
      "Cache-Control header. Add support for this header,\n",
      "specifically for the no-store and max-age\n",
      "values. If the Cache-Control header contains any value\n",
      "other than these two, it’s best not to cache the response.\n",
      "1-9 Compression. Add support for HTTP compression, in which\n",
      "the browser informs\n",
      "the server that compressed data is acceptable. Your browser must\n",
      "send the Accept-Encoding header with the value\n",
      "gzip. If the server supports compression, its response will\n",
      "have a Content-Encoding header with value\n",
      "gzip. The body is then compressed. Add support for this\n",
      "case. To decompress the data, you can use the decompress\n",
      "method in the gzip module. GZip data is not\n",
      "utf8-encoded, so pass \"rb\" to\n",
      "makefile to work with raw bytes instead. Most web servers\n",
      "send compressed data in a Transfer-Encoding called chunked.There are also a couple of\n",
      "Transfer-Encodings that compress the data. They aren’t\n",
